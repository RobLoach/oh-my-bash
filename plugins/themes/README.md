# Themes Plugin

This plugin allows you to change Oh-My-Bash themes on the go.

To use it, add `themes` to the plugins array in your `.bashrc` file:

```
plugins=(... themes)
```

This is based off the [themes oh-my-zsh plugin](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/themes).

## Usage

`theme <theme_name>` - Changes the theme to specified theme.

`theme ` - Changes the theme to some random theme.

`lstheme ` - Lists installed themes.
